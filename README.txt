HeroOgler v1
by TalonGrayson

-- Overview --

HeroOgler is an assistant for using OGLE and GLIntercept to capture 3D models of City of Heroes. It has been designed to work with Homecoming, and other flavours of CoX may not work.

OGLE and GLIntercept only work on Windows (as far as I'm aware), so HeroOgler has been designed to run in Windows only.

You can use this to capture a model of your toon, of scenery, or of anything else represented in the OpenGL space.

Once captured, the .obj file can be imported into your 3D modelling software of choice and fixed up, ready for 3D printing, rigging/animation, etc.


-- How to use --

1. Run Install.bat and follow the prompts
2. When you want to capture something, run Launch.bat
3. Once you're in the game, use Shift + Ctrl + L to capture the frame


-- Additional --

You can create a shortcut to Launch.bat and put it somewhere convenient, but please don't change the file structure within the HeroOgler folder, as that will break things.
