# HeroOgler
HeroOgler is an assistant for using OGLE and GLIntercept to capture 3D models of City of Heroes. It has been designed to work with Homecoming, and other flavours of CoX may not work.

OGLE and GLIntercept only work on Windows (as far as I'm aware), so HeroOgler has been designed to run in Windows only.

You can use this to capture a model of your toon, of scenery, or of anything else represented in the OpenGL space.

Once captured, the .obj file can be imported into your 3D modelling software of choice and fixed up, ready for 3D printing, rigging/animation, etc.

### How to Use
- Extract the zip into a convenient folder. It doesn't really matter where.
- Run HeroOgler.bat - you'll need to run this as an administrator the first time (or any time you need to install GLIntercept). This is because the batch file creates an OGLE folder in the appropriate place.
- Once everything is installed, if you want to capture something, just run HeroOgler.bat
- If HeroOgler detects an issue with your OGLE setup, it will try to fix it.
- Once you're in the game, use Shift + Ctrl + L to capture the frame

### Additional
You can create a shortcut to Launch.bat and put it somewhere convenient, but please don't change the file structure within the HeroOgler folder, as that will break things.

### Many thanks to the following:

[GLIntercept](https://github.com/dtrebilco/glintercept) - special thanks now that this supports 64-bit  
[OGLE for GLIntercept](https://github.com/dgis/OGLE-for-GLIntercept) - special thanks now that this supports 64-bit

And of course, every single soul who was involved in the original development of City of Heroes, to those who brought it back to life post-sunset, and to every last player who makes it worth the effort.
