HeroOgler is an assistant for using OGLE and GLIntercept to capture 3D models of City of Heroes

### How to Use
- Extract the zip into a convenient folder. It doesn't really matter where.
- Run Install.bat and follow the prompts
- When you want to capture something, run Launch.bat
- Once you're in the game, use Shift + Ctrl + L to capture the frame

### Many thanks to the following:

[GLIntercept](https://github.com/dtrebilco/glintercept) - special thanks now that this supports 64-bit  
[OGLE for GLIntercept](https://github.com/dgis/OGLE-for-GLIntercept) - special thanks now that this supports 64-bit  
[@leeper48](https://forums.homecomingservers.com/profile/54401-leeper48/) - his efforts have been instrumental in bringing this to life  

And of course, every single soul who was involved in the original development of City of Heroes, to those who brought it back to life post-sunset, and to every last player who makes it worth the effort.
